# Smart Reader Firefox Extension

Processes web content with Gemini AI or Ollama and converts it to speech using local Kokoro TTS (or OpenAI TTS endpoint). The prompt is focused on parsing and converting mathematical notation (LaTeX, MathJax) to spoken English.

The TTS implementation is based on https://github.com/BassGaming/customtts.

## Configuration

### LLM provider

#### Option 1: Gemini AI (Cloud-based)

1. Get a free API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey)
2. Open the extension popup by clicking the Smart Reader icon
3. Select "Gemini AI" as your AI model
4. In the "Gemini AI Configuration" section:
   - **API URL**: Use the default or customize for your needs
   - **API Key**: Enter your Gemini API key
5. Click "Save AI Configuration"

#### Option 2: Ollama (Local)

1. Install and run [Ollama](https://ollama.ai/) on your local machine
2. Pull a model (e.g., `ollama pull llama3.2:latest`)
3. Open the extension popup by clicking the Smart Reader icon
4. Select "Ollama" as your AI model
5. In the "Ollama Configuration" section:
   - **API URL**: Usually `http://localhost:11434` (default Ollama port)
   - **Model**: Enter the model name (e.g., `llama3.2:latest`, `mistral:latest`)
6. Click "Save AI Configuration"

### Custom Prompt Configuration

You can customize how the AI processes your content by choosing between default and custom prompts:

#### Default Prompt
- Pre-configured for mathematical notation and TTS optimization
- Converts LaTeX/MathJax to spoken English
- Handles programming code with summaries
- Returns regular text unchanged

#### Custom Prompts
1. In the extension popup, go to "Custom Prompt Configuration"
2. Select "Custom Prompt" radio button
3. Enter your custom prompt in the text area
4. Use `${content}` as a placeholder for the selected text
5. Click "Save Prompt Configuration"

**Template Examples:**
- **Summarize**: "Summarize the following content in clear, concise language suitable for text-to-speech: ${content}"
- **Explain Simply**: "Explain the following content in simple terms that anyone can understand: ${content}"
- **Math to Speech**: "Convert mathematical content to natural spoken language: ${content}"
- **Key Points**: "Extract the key points from the following content: ${content}"

### TTS Setup

TTS provider is OpenAI compatible, I recommend https://github.com/remsky/Kokoro-FastAPI/

1. Set up your TTS server (e.g., using Kokoro TTS or similar)
2. In the extension popup, configure the "TTS Configuration" section:
   - **TTS API URL**: Your TTS server endpoint (e.g., `http://localhost:8880/v1`)
   - **TTS API Key**: Usually "not-needed" for local setups
   - **Voice**: Voice identifier (e.g., `af_bella+af_sky`)
   - **Model**: TTS model name (e.g., `kokoro`)
   - **Speech Speed**: 0.1-10.0 (1.0 = normal speed)
   - **Streaming Mode**: Enable for real-time audio streaming
3. Click "Save TTS Configuration"

## Usage

### Method 1: HTML Block Selection

1. Click the Smart Reader extension icon to open the popup
2. Click "Select HTML Block"
3. The popup will close - now hover over elements on the page
4. Click on the HTML element you want to process
5. The extension will automatically:
   - Process the content with Gemini AI
   - Convert it to speech using TTS
   - Start playing the audio

### Method 2: Context Menu

1. Select any text on a webpage
2. Right-click and choose "Smart Reader: Process Selected Text"
3. The text will be processed and spoken automatically

### Controls

- **Stop Playback**: Use the "Stop Playback" button in the popup to halt audio
- **Real-time Processing**: Content is processed and spoken immediately after selection

## How It Works

1. **Content Selection**: User selects HTML blocks or text
2. **AI Processing**: Your chosen AI model (Gemini or Ollama) processes the content using either:
   - **Default Prompt**: Optimized for math notation, code summaries, and TTS
   - **Custom Prompt**: Your personalized instructions for content processing
3. **Speech Synthesis**: Processed text is sent to TTS
4. **Audio Playback**: High-quality speech is streamed and played

### Processing Examples

**Default Prompt (Math)**:
- Input: `âˆ‘_{i=1}^n x_i^2`
- Output: "sum from i equals one to n of x sub i squared"

**Custom Prompt (Summarization)**:
- Input: Long article about machine learning
- Output: "This article explains three key concepts in machine learning: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning."
