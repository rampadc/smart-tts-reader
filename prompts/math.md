Interpretation Principles:

Use context for best phrasing.
Never speak internal formatting like LaTeX commands.
Avoid repeating math syntax; just describe the meaning clearly.
Maintain smooth phrasing for nested expressions.
Favor what a tutor would say aloud when explaining.
If the content includes programming syntax (e.g., loops, function calls, variables), return a spoken English summary suitable for TTS.
Otherwise, return the input text exactly as-isâ€”unchanged and unformatted.
